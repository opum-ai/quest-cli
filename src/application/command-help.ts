      'Initialize a Quest workspace in the current Git worktree. On a real terminal with no flags, prompts for project name, task ID prefix, then a multi-select listing supported instruction files (CLAUDE.md for Claude Code, AGENTS.md for Codex/OpenCode/pi/etc., GEMINI.md for Google Antigravity/Gemini CLI) -- tick zero, one, or more; nothing is pre-checked. --target claude/codex/antigravity writes exactly one non-interactively (requires --agent-instructions; the default target for a scripted --agent-instructions with no --target remains AGENTS.md, unchanged, so existing callers are unaffected -- only the interactive prompt changed). --skill-source takes "repo" (the default, unset: generate .claude/skills/quest/SKILL.md into this repository), "plugin" (the skill ships from the opum-quest Claude Code plugin instead), or "none" (this workspace generates no quest skill file and none ships from anywhere -- the value for a workspace that does not use Claude Code at all, so a Codex-only or Antigravity-only consumer need not declare "plugin", which would assert a plugin they do not have). "plugin" and "none" behave identically on every file operation and differ only in what they assert; given on the SAME call as --agent-instructions, either also skips writing the skill file this time ("explicit beats config" holds only against a persisted skillSource from an earlier call, not against an explicit --skill-source given in the same breath). With --agent-instructions and a claude or codex target (scripted or ticked), data.plugins.<runtime> reports whether that runtime has the opum-quest marketplace plugin (installed, disabled, not-installed, not-detectable) and what to run next; init never installs, enables or updates it (QCLI-371). Refuses if already initialized -- use `quest init --reconfigure` on an existing workspace instead of deleting .quest/ and starting over. --reconfigure accepts --name, --task-id-prefix and --skill-source, in any combination or none; it persists --skill-source exactly as a first init does, which is how an already-initialized workspace opts out of the skill file after the fact. A first init also writes the canonical [tasks] vocabulary (types feature, bug, chore, docs, enhancement, spike; priorities low, medium, high, critical) into .quest/workspace.toml, and task create/edit/edit-batch then accept only those values, storing a case-only difference in the configured spelling (QCLI-330). --reconfigure, bare or with fields, adds that default only to a workspace that configures neither field and never changes a configured set; a workspace with no [tasks] table stays open, validating nothing.',

A --check call must pass the same --target the block was written with -- it checks exactly one file per invocation, never more than one; a --check with no --target checks AGENTS.md, and exits 6 naming the --target to use when AGENTS.md has no Quest block but CLAUDE.md or GEMINI.md carries one. The skill file (.claude/skills/quest/SKILL.md) is separate: when this workspace\'s agents.skill_source is "plugin" or "none" (set via `quest init --skill-source ...`, on a first init or a --reconfigure), it is neither written nor proposed -- a leftover reports as drift, and --force removes it only when its bytes exactly match what Quest would generate; a hand-edited file is never removed. "none" is the value for a workspace with no Claude Code at all: it behaves exactly as "plugin" does here, and says only that no skill file is generated, never that a plugin provides one. A block that differs from the installed CLI only in its one embedded version number reports "version-only" and does not fail --check (a routine patch/minor bump alone is not drift); any other difference, including a version bump paired with real content change, still reports drift and fails. --update-instructions always refreshes to the exact current bytes regardless, so the file never falls permanently behind. With the claude or codex target, data.plugin reports the opum-quest marketplace plugin as installed, disabled, not-installed or not-detectable, read through the `plugin list --json` of that runtime CLI; --check only reports it and prints what to run, and --update-instructions with an explicit --target runs the plugin update for an installed plugin (with no --target it only reports) but never installs or enables one (QCLI-371; neither changes the exit code; QUEST_AGENT_PLUGINS=off skips it). A leftover Backlog.md installer block (its own BACKLOG.MD GUIDELINES START/END markers) is a real contradiction, not silently ignored: --check reports drift even when the Quest block is otherwise exact, and --update-instructions removes it -- bounded to exactly that delimited block, touching nothing else.',

SCOPE (QCLI-316): this reads the CHECKED-OUT ref's .quest/ and nothing else, so a result -- and an EMPTY result especially -- is a claim about that branch, not about the repository. A task filed on an unmerged branch is invisible here, which is exactly the task most likely to be forgotten. Every listing carries a `scope` field naming the branch it answered about; when the result is empty, scope also reports `unseenTaskIds`, the ids that exist on some other ref and not on this one (filenames only, one tree listing per ref, no record is read and no status is merged across refs). An empty list with an empty `unseenTaskIds` is load-bearing; an empty list naming ids is the check not having run on them. Before reporting that nothing is open, read `scope`, and cross-check an independent source such as `gh pr list`. `quest task list --across-refs` (QCLI-417) is the complete form of that answer: one read-only view over origin/dev plus every open PR head into dev, with per-state provenance and a coverage report, so a nothing-open answer holds for the repository only when every planned ref was read. See `quest help 'task list --across-refs'` -- that invocation, not this one, is where the flags it takes are documented. --fields <a,b,...> (QCLI-312 / DEC-161) projects each record to EXACTLY the named top-level fields, for a narrow read: under --json every item carries exactly those keys (a named field absent from a record is null, never a dropped key), and under --plain each task is one TAB-separated line in the order named.

A record that exists only on a PR head is reported as `proposedBy` that PR; an id whose states disagree lists EVERY state with its own refProvenance and sets `conflict: true`, and no winner is picked -- resolving it is a judgement call this view does not make. Filters (--status, --label, --limit, ...) compose as they do on `task list`: an entry matches when ANY of its states matches, and a matched entry still shows all of its states. --ready is the one filter not accepted here: readiness is evaluated over one coherent dependency graph, and a PR head can legitimately carry a task whose dependency is not on that branch at all. COVERAGE, a top-level key after `data`: {complete, population, discoveredAt, refsRead, refsUnreadable}. `complete` is true only when every planned ref was read without error, so 'nothing is open' holds for the repository only then. Incomplete coverage exits 6 with the unreadable refs named in the message and the whole coverage object in the error's `input`; --allow-partial downgrades that to exit 0 with complete false and the same refs still named. A read of ZERO refs is the one exception -- that is no coverage rather than partial coverage, so it still exits 6 even with --allow-partial. --ref <ref> and --pr <N> (both repeatable) replace discovery with an explicit population and need no forge: --pr resolves refs/pull/<N>/head through Git alone. OFFLINE: discovery is `gh pr list --repo <slug> --state open --base dev`; with no gh on PATH, or an origin remote that is not GitHub, the run reports incomplete coverage -- exit 6, or 0 under --allow-partial with population dev-only and complete false -- and never fails as an uncaught error. A listing that was truncated at gh's limit, or that carried rows this view cannot use, counts as incomplete for the same reason: a narrowed population must not report complete. Exit 3 when origin or origin/dev is absent. Exit 5 is never used: two refs disagreeing about a task's status is data, not a command conflict.

A throwaway probe task is archived like any other; that cost is accepted rather than solved with a destructive verb. Deleting would not deliver clean removal in any case, since .quest/ is committed to Git and the record stays recoverable from history. `--if-revision <revision>` is an optional precondition (QCLI-423): capture `revision` from `task view --json`, and a value that does not match the record's current revision refuses with an exit-5 conflict -- carrying input.sentRevision beside input.actualRevision -- and moves nothing, so a guarded edit followed by an archive has no unguarded window.",
