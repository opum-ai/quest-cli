/**
 * QCLI-417 / DEC-40 (operator-accepted 2026-09-29), recorded as the opum-doc
 * ADR "keep lore and quest records on the branch with a read-only view across
 * open PRs" (ODOC-330). QCLI-316 gave a listing a `scope` field because
 * `quest task list --status "In Progress"` reads the CHECKED-OUT ref and
 * nothing else, so an empty answer reads as the repository being clear when it
 * only means that branch was. This is the complete form of that answer: one
 * read-only view over `origin/dev` plus the head of every OPEN PR into `dev`,
 * with per-state provenance and a coverage report, so "nothing is open" holds
 * for the repository only when every planned ref was actually read.
 *
 * THE POPULATION IS EXPLICIT AND ITS COMPLETENESS TRAVELS WITH THE ANSWER.
 * `open-prs` requires a forge-aware, base-filtered discovery; nothing Git-only
 * may claim it (see `src/ports/ref-discovery.ts` for the measurement that
 * settled that). When discovery fails, the answer is a coverage failure naming
 * what could not be read -- never a quiet narrowing of the population to
 * whatever happened to be readable.
 *
 * EVERY STATE IS LISTED AND NO WINNER IS PICKED. Two refs carrying the same id
 * with different statuses is a conflict, not a merge: the entry carries
 * `conflict: true` and both states with their own `refProvenance`. Inventing a
 * merge policy for tracker state is a much larger decision than this view, and
 * the caller is the one who can resolve it.
 *
 * THE VIEW NEVER WRITES. It reads blobs and trees at SHAs, may fetch missing
 * OBJECTS through a bare refspec with an explicit empty `--refmap=` (objects
 * and FETCH_HEAD only -- no ref, and no remote-tracking ref either; a bare
 * refspec alone still let Git's opportunistic update move
 * `refs/remotes/origin/dev`), and never touches the working tree: a record
 * that exists only uncommitted in a checkout is not in the view, which
 * `quest help task list --across-refs` says in as many words.
 *
 * `refProvenance`, not `provenance`: lore's query hits already use the latter
 * name for a different shape, and the two CLIs ship the byte-identical inner
 * object `{ref, pullRequest, sha}` (DEC-40 D2).
