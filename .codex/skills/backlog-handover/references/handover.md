# Status and handover

## Status mode

Stay read-only after the mandatory Backlog overview. Ground the active tracker, queued and in-flight
tasks, branch/worktree state, and lifecycle audit. Report resolved, in-flight, blocked/human, and
ready counts plus one next action. Do not fetch merely for status.

## Write mode

Write only for a named human decision/blocker or a session renewal forced by an environment stop or
context that is demonstrably no longer reliable—not a successful wave, merged PR, cleanup pass, or
subjective context-size preference. Classify the stop as exactly one of `human-decision` or
`session-renewal`.
Flush task and compact tracker facts through Backlog, then mechanically audit the tracker before
replacing `.claude/handovers/active.md`:

```sh
backlog doc view <tracker-id> --plain | node .codex/skills/backlog-handover/scripts/audit-campaign-tracker.mjs
```

It must be at most 200 lines and 32 KiB. Keep the handover below 120 lines and 16 KiB:

```markdown
# Handover — <campaign>
**Lifecycle**: executable-current
**Grounded against**: <quest-cli branch, full SHA, dirty/ahead state>
**Tracker**: <id and title>
**Mode**: autonomous-docs
**Stop class**: <human-decision | session-renewal>
## Paste-ready prompt
Run `/clear`, start a new session in `quest-cli`, then use `$backlog-handover restore`. Continue the
persisted campaign and tracker without reconfirmation; recompute readiness live.
## State
- Resolved: <count>
- In flight: <count>
- Blocked: <count>
- Ready: <count>
## In flight
| Task | Worktree/branch | Last verified tree and stage | Blocker or next action |
## Retained artifacts
| Artifact | Owner | Reason | Cleanup condition |
## Decision required
<Exact decision/blocker for human-decision; `None — session renewal` otherwise.>
## Next action
<One exact action. For session-renewal, repeat `/clear`, new quest-cli session, and
`$backlog-handover restore`; for human-decision, name the user's one required action.>
## Exceptions
```

The lifecycle audit rejects missing grounding, queue counts, stop classification, artifact
disposition, exact next action, or incomplete session-renewal language. After writing a
`human-decision` cursor, the final response leads with the decision required. After writing a
`session-renewal` cursor, the final response leads with the `/clear` and restore sequence. Never say
only “continue,” “context is large,” “start a new session,” or “see handover.”

Historical handovers use the historical marker, omit the prompt, and contain no imperative or
`$backlog-handover` continuation text. After grounding live state, run the lifecycle audit with all
expected values so a well-formed but stale cursor cannot pass:

```sh
node .codex/skills/backlog-handover/scripts/audit-handover-lifecycle.mjs \
  --expect-tracker <doc-id> --expect-sha <worktree-head> --expect-branch <branch> \
  --expect-worktree <absolute-path> --expect-state <resolved,in-flight,blocked,ready>
```

Do not report a handover written until this grounded invocation passes.
