# Quest CLI package and release

## Purpose

Qualify immutable Quest package candidates, publish only under explicit owner
authorization, and retain accurate availability and rollback truth when a
release does not complete.

## Prerequisites

- A reviewed source commit and the exact root plus six platform tarballs:
  darwin/linux/win32 on x64 and arm64.
- The exact Bun version this repository pins (`packageManager` in
  `package.json`; the workflows' `bun-version` matches it), for any build
  covering all six platforms **and any `bun install`/lockfile touch before
  it**. Cross-compiling `bun-windows-aarch64` requires a recent Bun: 1.2.x
  refuses it outright with `error: Unsupported compile target`, and
  `build:packages` then stops after four of six, leaving the tree
  half-built. A mismatched Bun is also more dangerous the other way:
  running `bun install` with 1.2.x against a repo pinned to 1.3.14 silently
  dropped `bun.lock`'s `configVersion` field — no error, no warning, just a
  lockfile in a format CI's frozen-lockfile install does not expect. Check
  `bun --version` against `package.json`'s `packageManager` before touching
  `bun.lock` or building, not after. `bun upgrade` does not take a version;
  use `bun update --version <version>`, or
  `curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash -s "bun-v<version>"` for an
  exact pin.
- Package checks that prove root/platform version and SHA-256 agreement,
  platform constraints, license, repository identity, and published-file
  contents. This is why platform binaries get built **locally, before any
  commit**, not via a CI dispatch on the branch: `check:packages` runs as
  part of `source-gates`, and `immutable-candidates` (the job that actually
  rebuilds the six platforms) `needs: source-gates` — so a commit whose
  platform packages don't yet match the bumped root version fails the very
  gate that would let CI fix it. That is expected, not a runbook gap: build
  locally with the matched Bun version first (previous bullet), commit
  root and platform changes together as one reviewed commit, and only then
  let CI validate it.

  **Qualified by "Why strings first, then bytes" below (QCLI-294).** The
  dependency this bullet describes is real, but "not via a CI dispatch" is
  too strong: a CI dispatch *can* produce the binaries, provided the version
  strings are synced in an earlier commit so `source-gates` stays green. On a
  host that cannot cross-compile all six targets, that is the only available
  route.
- A native-execution receipt emitted by the tagged CI run, binding that exact
  commit and version. A receipt made by hand after the fact is not acceptable
  evidence: the one that existed before QCLI-135 outlived the release it
  described, and downstream qualification then failed closed against it.
- Trusted publishing configured for all seven package names, **created by hand
  for each one**. It does not propagate: `@opum-ai/lore` published 0.1.0 through
  0.3.4 with no trusted publisher and only gained one before 0.3.5, on the same
  npm account, the same organization and the same scope as Quest.

  To check whether a package has ever published through it, without publishing:
  npm attaches a provenance attestation automatically on an OIDC publish, so the
  attestation is a fossil of how each version shipped.

  ```sh
  curl -s https://registry.npmjs.org/@opum-ai%2Fquest \
    | python3 -c "import json,sys;d=json.load(sys.stdin);print({v:('attestations' in d['versions'][v].get('dist',{})) for v in d['versions']})"
  ```

  There is no read path for the configuration itself — no CLI subcommand, and
  the `/access` page is browser-only — so this is the only way to tell from
  outside.
- Trusted publishing configured for all seven package names. npm restricted
  classic tokens for direct publishing, so a stored token cannot publish: both a
  local `npm publish` and the workflow's `NPM_TOKEN` return E404 on PUT, npm's
  response to a token that cannot write to the scope. Granular tokens are capped
  at 90 days and must be created on the website, so a token-based release stops
  working every quarter and surfaces as a stalled release rather than a warning.

  One-time setup per package, at `https://www.npmjs.com/package/<name>/access` —
  not the account settings page — for `@opum-ai/quest` and each of the six
  platform packages:

  | Field | Value |
  | --- | --- |
  | Organization | `opum-ai` |
  | Repository | `quest-cli` |
  | Workflow filename | `release.yml` (filename only, not a path) |
  | Environment | `release` (the job declares one) |

  **npm returns E404 on PUT for at least four different causes** and gives no
  way to tell them apart: a token that cannot write to the scope, a token that
  does not authenticate, an npm below the OIDC floor that silently skipped
  trusted publishing, and no trust relationship at all. Quest's 0.3.0 release
  hit three of the four in sequence. The workflow now eliminates the first
  three before the registry is touched — no token is configured, the npm floor
  is asserted rather than assumed — so an E404 that survives all of that means
  the configuration is missing or mistyped.

  Every field is case-sensitive and **npm does not validate them on save**, so a
  typo appears only as a failed publish. GitHub-hosted runners only.
- Explicit owner authorization immediately before publication. This task does
  not reserve a name, alter registry access, or publish on its own.

## What a version bump touches

Before "a reviewed source commit" above can exist, the version itself has to
move in every place that carries it. Established by a pre-0.7.0 version audit
(OPAG-142) and corrected during the 0.7.0 bump itself (QCLI-294), which found
one site the audit had missed -- verify against source before trusting this
list for a release further out than the one that produced it.

**Sync the version STRINGS first, then replace the BINARY bytes -- in two
commits, not one.** This is the ordering the rest of this section assumes, and
getting it backwards strands the release: see "Why strings first, then bytes"
below, which also reconciles this section with the Prerequisites bullet above.

**Hand-edited, independently -- nothing here derives from anything else:**

- `package.json` (root) `.version` -- the actual source of truth: everything
  generated below reads from this field, not the other way round.
- `src/application/version.ts`'s `QUEST_VERSION` constant. Its own doc
  comment calls it "the single release-version source of truth," but it is
  **not derived from `package.json`** -- a comment claiming an authority the
  file does not have. A bump that only touches `package.json` leaves this
  stale, and `bun run check` will not catch it; only `bun run test:packages`
  does.
- `src/contract/tracker/index.ts`'s `QUEST_ADAPTER_PINNED_VERSION` constant.
  Has its own pinning test, same failure mode as above if skipped.
- `fixtures/tracker/v1/conformance.json`'s `questVersion` golden value.
- `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`'s `.version`. **The audit that produced the
  first version of this list missed this file, and it had already been wrong
  for two releases** -- it read `0.6.0` from the 2026-09-10 repository
  recreation until QCLI-294 moved it, so it was stale through the abortive
  0.6.1 and through the 0.6.2 that actually shipped. QCLI-258 (the 0.6.0
  release) listed it as a hand-edited site, and that knowledge was simply
  lost. Nothing generates it and no test compares it to `package.json`, which
  is exactly why it drifted silently; treat its presence on this list as the
  only thing currently preventing a third occurrence.
- Root `package.json`'s six `optionalDependencies` pins (`@opum-ai/quest-<platform>`),
  which `check:packages` requires to equal the root version exactly.

**Generated, not hand-edited -- `scripts/build-platform-packages.mjs` is the
generator:**

- `npm/quest-<platform>/package.json` for all six platforms (`darwin-arm64`,
  `darwin-x64`, `linux-arm64`, `linux-x64`, `win32-arm64`, `win32-x64`).
- `npm/quest-<platform>/bin/quest`(`.exe`) for all six.
- Root `package.json`'s `questPlatformPackages` checksum map.

The script reads `version` from root `package.json` -- confirming root as the
one real source of truth above -- then, in the *same pass*, both writes each
platform manifest and recompiles that platform's binary
(`bun build --compile`). **There is no manifest-only mode.** That is the
actual mechanism behind "Anchor every artifact claim to stored bytes" below:
this script cannot be safely re-run against an already-published version to
fix a manifest typo alone, because doing so also produces a new, non-byte-
identical binary for a release that already shipped a different one. Before
publish -- preparing a new bump, nothing published yet -- running it via a CI
dispatch against the release branch (see "Exercising a build before it is
published") is the normal, correct procedure, not an exception to this rule.

**Also generated, separately:**

- CLAUDE.md's managed Quest block (the "Quest CLI `<version>`" sentence), via
  `quest agents --update-instructions --target claude`. Run it against the
  **freshly built local binary** for this machine's own architecture (e.g.
  `./npm/quest-darwin-arm64/bin/quest agents --update-instructions --target
  claude`), never the globally installed CLI on `PATH` -- it reads its own
  running version, not `package.json`. Regenerating against a stale global
  install silently reports `state: current` against itself; this exact
  mistake happened at the 0.6.1 bump.

**Not covered by any of the above, and not yet automated:** `bun.lock`'s
platform-package pins (its `optionalDependencies` block and the resolved
package entries) stay at whatever version they were last generated at until
someone runs `bun install`. This broke `bun install --frozen-lockfile` in CI
at the 0.6.2 bump and was patched once as a one-off. Touch `bun.lock` on
every bump regardless of whether QCLI-292 (tracking making this automatic or
checked) is done -- see that task for the fix-it-properly work, not
duplicated here.

**Not part of the bump commit:** `CHANGELOG.md`'s `## Unreleased` heading
becomes `## <version>` at tag time (Step 5 below), not when the version
files above are committed -- moving it early makes the changelog claim a
release before qualification has run. It is a RENAME PLUS A NEW HEADING, not
a rename: step 5 leaves a fresh empty `## Unreleased` above the section it
just named. Omitting the successor is what produced QCLI-319 -- four
consumer-observable changes landed on `dev` after the 0.7.1 tag with no
heading to be recorded under, and nobody noticed until a consumer reported it
could not detect one of them by any means. An absent section is invisible in
a way a wrong section is not: nothing reads as missing.

### Why strings first, then bytes

The Prerequisites bullet above says platform binaries are built "locally,
before any commit, not via a CI dispatch on the branch," and the first
version of this section said a CI dispatch was simply the normal procedure.
**Both were incomplete, and the disagreement was real rather than a wording
difference** -- recorded here rather than silently resolved, because the
mechanism underneath is what a bump actually has to obey.

`check-package-artifacts.mjs` tests two things *independently*: that every
version string agrees (root `.version`, each `optionalDependencies` pin, each
platform manifest's `.version`), and that every checksum agrees with the bytes
it describes (each manifest's `questBinarySha256` and root's
`questPlatformPackages` entry, both against the actual binary on disk). A
commit can therefore satisfy the second while moving only the first.

That is the intermediate state a bump needs, because of a CI dependency that
is otherwise a trap. `check:packages` runs inside `source-gates`;
`immutable-candidates` -- the job that rebuilds the six platforms -- declares
`needs: source-gates`. So a commit that bumps only the root version fails
`check:packages` on a version mismatch, `source-gates` goes red, and the
rebuild job never runs: **the gate that would let CI fix it is the gate the
mismatch breaks.** That is what the Prerequisites bullet is warning about, and
it is correct as far as it goes.

The way through is two commits:

1. **Strings.** Move every hand-edited site above *and* each platform
   manifest's `.version` field. Leave the binaries, the `questBinarySha256`
   fields and the `questPlatformPackages` map untouched -- each still matches
   its own (now-previous-version) bytes, so the checksum half still passes
   while the version half now reads the new number. `check:packages` exits 0
   in this state; verified at the 0.7.0 bump.
2. **Bytes.** With `source-gates` green, dispatch the qualification workflow
   against the branch, let `immutable-candidates` build all six platforms with
   the new version compiled in, then download the `quest-package-<target>`
   artifacts and commit the real binaries, regenerated manifests and updated
   checksums.

A local `build:packages` run is a legitimate substitute for step 2 on a host
that can cross-compile all six targets; it is not available on a host that
cannot, and on macOS it additionally risks the code-signing hazard documented
below. Neither route changes step 1, which is required either way.

## Steps

1. Build candidates from the reviewed commit. Record the source SHA, Bun
   version, root checksum, each platform checksum, and every compiler fallback
   used. A local compiler cache is build infrastructure, never a package
   payload. Before committing a rebuilt `npm/quest-darwin-arm64/bin/quest`,
   see "A locally-rebuilt darwin-arm64 binary can SIGKILL git on this host"
   below -- executing it before the final delete-and-recreate, not after,
   avoids a real host-level hazard.

2. Run the artifact and packed-tarball gates:

   ```sh
   bun run check:packages
   bun run test:packages
   ```

   The candidate must contain only the root Node launcher or a single platform
   binary, its manifest, and the license. It must not ship source TypeScript,
   development fixtures, private workspace paths, or a host Bun dependency.

3. Require QCLI-93's qualification evidence to name the exact clean-install
   harness and immutable tarball for every platform target. It must cover
   `quest --version`, `quest manifest --json`, a task operation, projection
   access/rebuild, and migration smoke behavior. Projection and migration
   smoke commands are not public 0.1 executable commands, so do not present
   invented interactive syntax here: a missing harness or unavailable target
   is an explicit publication-blocking gate, not an assumed pass.

4. Run the complete qualification record: type, formatting, layer, unit,
   contract, integration, black-box, fault, clone/worktree, migration, scale,
   package, provenance, dependency-license, checksum, and repository-identity
   checks. Attach each command, result, candidate checksum, and skipped-gate
   reason to the release evidence.

5. Finalize the changelog, then tag. Rename `CHANGELOG.md`'s `## Unreleased`
   heading to `## <version>`, **and add a fresh empty `## Unreleased` heading
   directly above it in the same edit**:

   ```markdown
   ## Unreleased

   ## <version>
   ```

   The empty heading is the step, not a courtesy. Every change that lands
   between this tag and the next one needs somewhere to be written down at
   the moment it lands. What was measured after the 0.7.1 tag, which left no
   successor: four consumer-observable changes landed on `dev` and not one
   carries a changelog entry (QCLI-319). Why each author wrote nothing was
   not measured and is not the point -- the heading costs two lines and
   removes the question.

   Then require the native-execution receipt for this exact commit and
   version, create the release tag, and dispatch the qualification workflow
   **against that tag**:

   ```sh
   git tag v<version> && git push origin v<version>
   gh workflow run prepublication-qualification.yml --ref v<version>
   ```

   Dispatch explicitly rather than relying on the tag push to trigger it. The
   workflow's `push` trigger carries a `paths` filter, which is evaluated
   against the tagged commit's own diff, so tagging a commit that did not
   touch those paths starts no run at all. A dispatch against the tag always
   does, and sets `github.ref` to `refs/tags/v<version>`, which is what the
   release-only jobs key off.

   On a tag ref each platform job executes the **committed** artifact rather
   than rebuilding it, having first attested that the binary on disk is
   byte-identical to the blob at that ref. Rebuilding would defeat the receipt:
   Bun's `--compile` output is not byte-reproducible, so a rebuilt binary is a
   different artifact from the one being published. An aggregation job then
   emits the receipt from the run's own metadata and uploads it as the
   `native-execution-receipt` artifact. Download it and run the gate:

   ```sh
   bun run receipt:require -- --receipt native-execution-receipt.json
   ```

   The gate re-derives every digest from the artifacts on disk rather than
   trusting the document, and refuses a receipt bound to any other commit or
   version. A failure here is publication-blocking: without it the run proves
   only that a binary built from this source executes on each target, not that
   the bytes about to be published do.

6. Immediately before a separately authorized publish, recheck the registry
   name and conflicts, the repository identity, current Lore release gate, and
   package metadata. If any fact changed, stop for an owner decision; do not
   substitute a package name or artifact.

7. Publish the exact reviewed immutable artifacts only after the owner grants
   that authorization. Dispatch the release workflow against the tag, dry run
   first:

   ```sh
   gh workflow run release.yml --ref v<version> -f publish=false
   gh workflow run release.yml --ref v<version> -f publish=true
   ```

   The workflow fetches the receipt from the qualification run for that exact
   commit rather than accepting one as input, and refuses to publish without
   it. Platform packages publish before the root, so the root never briefly
   advertises `optionalDependencies` that do not exist. Then clean-install from the registry and repeat the
   public version, manifest, task, projection, and migration smokes. Only this
   successful verification permits availability or install documentation.

   If the CI/OIDC publish path is unavailable (see "Publishing locally when
   CI cannot" below), `scripts/publish-release.mjs` performs the same
   fail-closed, receipt-gated publish from an operator's own machine.

8. Confirm the receipt describes what the registry actually serves, then hand
   it to downstream qualification:

   ```sh
   bun run receipt:verify-published -- <version> --receipt native-execution-receipt.json
   ```

   This downloads all six platform tarballs and compares each binary's digest
   to the receipt. Publish the receipt to the consuming harness only after it
   passes; a receipt that describes a build nobody published is the exact
   failure this step exists to prevent.

## Promoting dev to main

Not one of the eight numbered steps above, deliberately: the release workflow
dispatches against the TAG (`--ref v<version>`), never against `main`, so
promoting `dev` is orthogonal to qualification and to publish. It can happen
any time after a reviewed commit lands on `dev` -- most naturally right after
step 5's tag-time commit -- and if the publish is later declined, `main`
carrying a prepared-but-unpublished version costs nothing; the tag is what
step 7 actually reads.

This repository gates `main`, not `dev` (see the repository profile in
`CLAUDE.md`): a `dev`-to-`main` PR triggers the same required checks a second
time, on a SHA that already passed them once on its way into `dev`. Learned
at the 0.8.0 promotion (QCLI-332), 2026-09-17, because each of these reads as
a broken promotion to whoever sees it for the first time mid-release:

- **Two full rounds of `source-gates` / `Tracker integrity` / `lore check`
  fire on one SHA.** "Green once" is not "done" -- read the newest run per
  required context (by `started_at`) from `gh api
  repos/opum-ai/quest-cli/commits/<sha>/check-runs`, intersected against the
  context names in `rules/branches/main`, and confirm zero non-`completed`
  runs remain before merging.
- **`promotion-is-manual` failing and `main-is-fast-forward-of-dev` skipping
  are the documented always-fail tripwire from
  `.github/workflows/promotion-guardrails.yml`, not blockers.** Neither is in
  the required-checks list; both exist only to stop the GitHub merge button
  from being used on this PR.
- **`mergeStateStatus` reading `UNSTABLE` is expected on this PR shape**, not
  evidence the promotion is broken.

Land it with `git push origin origin/dev:main` -- the remote-tracking ref,
never bare `dev:main`, which resolves to a local branch that can be stale and
silently no-ops instead of promoting anything -- chained on the check with
`&&`, never `;`. Never the merge button: it staples a merge commit onto
`main` that never reaches `dev`, breaking the fast-forward ancestor invariant
this whole procedure depends on. Assert the result from the API (`gh api
repos/opum-ai/quest-cli/git/ref/heads/main`) rather than trusting the push's
exit code, then fetch and read `origin/main` before reporting it -- local
`main` is stale in any session that has been promoting, because the push
never checks `main` out.

## A locally-rebuilt darwin-arm64 binary can SIGKILL git on this host

Host-specific, not a code defect, confirmed via live kernel log capture
(QCLI-271): once a freshly built `npm/quest-darwin-arm64/bin/quest` has been
**executed** on a machine that code-signs and validates Mach-O binaries at
mmap time, any subsequent git operation that reads that exact file --
`status`, `diff`, `add`, `hash-object`, `commit`, even an unscoped `git
status` that merely refreshes the whole index -- gets killed outright
(`exit 137`). `log stream` at the moment of the kill shows the kernel's own
diagnosis: `CODE SIGNING: cs_invalid_page(...) ... denying page ... sending
SIGKILL`, naming the exact path, with the process marked `tainted:1`. Only
`darwin-arm64` is affected -- it is the only platform binary that is
natively executable (and therefore code-signed and validated) on this class
of host; the `linux-*`/`win32-*` binaries never engage this kernel path.

**A fresh inode (delete-then-recreate the file) is necessary but NOT
sufficient.** Recreating the file clears stale validation state tied to the
old inode, so a git operation on the fresh copy succeeds -- right up until
the fresh copy is itself *executed*. Executing it taints its own vnode for
subsequent git access, even though a git-only read (e.g. `git hash-object`)
on that same inode had already succeeded moments earlier. So the ordering
that actually avoids the kill is:

1. Do every execution you need against the freshly built binary first
   (`--version`, `agents --update-instructions`, whatever the release step
   requires).
2. Delete the file and recreate it fresh from the untouched build artifact,
   as the **literal last step** before any git command touches it.
3. Run git operations against it with **zero execution** in between that
   final recreate and the commit.

If a git operation on this path gets killed anyway, do not try to strip
quarantine attributes, re-sign, or otherwise bypass the platform's
validation -- escalate instead. The escape hatch for finishing an unrelated
commit while this is unresolved is plumbing that never mmaps the working-tree
file: `git show HEAD:<path>` + `cp` to revert a single file's content, and
`git update-index --cacheinfo <mode>,<sha>,<path>` to unstage one, both avoid
the working-tree read that `git checkout --`/`git reset --` perform. A killed
git process can leave a stale `.git/index.lock`; verify with `ps`/`lsof` that
nothing still holds it before removing the lock file by hand.

This is a **general macOS code-signing hazard**, not specific to Quest's own
build step -- see opum-doc's fleet-wide reference,
[`native-macos-binary-git-sigkill-hazard.md`](https://github.com/opum-ai/opum-doc/blob/main/docs/reference/native-macos-binary-git-sigkill-hazard.md)
(ODOC-188), for the mechanism in general terms. QCLI-275 (converging
`npm/*/bin/` packaging on a build-in-CI, never-commit shape) would remove
this repository's exposure to it as a side effect, but is not a substitute
for the execution-ordering discipline above wherever a native binary is
still built and committed locally.

## Publishing locally when CI cannot

`scripts/publish-release.mjs` exists for exactly the case the CI/OIDC path
cannot cover -- trusted publishing not yet configured, or (as observed
2026-09) GitHub's org-wide immutable-subject-claim policy rejecting the
subject shape npm Trusted Publishing expects. It is gated the same way CI is:
`--receipt <path>` is required, and the receipt must bind the exact commit
and version being published (`validateReceipt`, re-deriving every digest from
the artifacts on disk rather than trusting the document).

```sh
node scripts/publish-release.mjs --receipt native-execution-receipt.json
node scripts/publish-release.mjs --publish --otp <code> --receipt native-execution-receipt.json
```

**Two auth mechanisms**, tried in this order, reported explicitly at the
start of a run so the operator knows which one is active:

1. **A stored npm granular access token** -- macOS Keychain under the service
   name `npm-opum-ai-publish`, or `$NPM_TOKEN`. Store one with (never typed
   where it lands in shell history):

   ```sh
   read -rs T
   security add-generic-password -a "$USER" -s npm-opum-ai-publish -w "$T" -U
   unset T
   ```

   Shape-checked before any publish attempt -- length, prefix, and an
   internal-whitespace flag, the value itself never logged. A granular token
   is `npm_` followed by 36 characters (length 40); anything else refuses to
   publish rather than attempt one. This matters because an npm `PUT` to an
   unauthorised package returns 404, not 403 (so as not to disclose whether
   the package exists) -- "not a token", "wrong token", and "token without
   rights" are otherwise indistinguishable, and a sibling repo's release
   burned two full publish attempts on a permissions theory before finding a
   malformed stored value was the actual cause. A token found this way
   bypasses the interactive OTP requirement entirely and is written to a
   *temporary* npmrc for the run only (`npm_config_userconfig`); `~/.npmrc`
   is never touched, and no `--otp` is required or sent.

2. **An interactive `npm login` session**, with `--otp <code>` on the real
   publish. This is the human path and needs 2FA at the point of the write,
   regardless of whether the login session itself succeeded -- a valid
   `npm whoami` does not mean the write will be accepted without an OTP.

Deliberately **not** implemented as a pre-publish readiness gate: `npm
whoami` (401s for a correctly scoped package-only granular token -- too
strict), `npm owner ls` (succeeds with no token at all -- vacuous), `npm
config get //registry.npmjs.org/:_authToken` (npm redacts the value -- a
false negative). Write permission is only observable by writing, which is
exactly why the two properties below matter together with fail-closed
platform-then-root ordering: a refusal costs one package, not the release.

**Resumable.** A target already on the registry at the exact version being
published is skipped, not re-attempted (`isPublished`, wrapping `npm view
<pkg>@<version> version`). A partial failure -- an expired OTP mid-sequence,
a transient network error -- can be cleared by simply re-running the same
command; whatever already landed is skipped rather than rejected as "cannot
publish over an existing version."

**Registry propagation lag is real and can be long.** After every platform
and the root publish successfully, the script waits for the registry's read
API to catch up with npm's own write confirmation before verifying (a single
shared backoff window across all seven packages, not one per package,
default 30 minutes). This is not paranoia: read-after-write lag has been
measured *worsening* release to release elsewhere in this fleet (seconds,
then tens of seconds, then tens of minutes). **A timeout here is reported as
registry lag, not a failed release** -- the write already succeeded, and
running `npm unpublish` in response is destructive, available for 72 hours,
and would remove a release that is not actually broken.

## Anchor every artifact claim to stored bytes

Bun's `--compile` output is **not byte-reproducible**: the same source at the
same Bun version produces a different binary on a different machine. Measured,
not assumed — six platform jobs each reported a mismatch against binaries built
locally minutes earlier.

So *rebuild and compare* is not available as a verification technique anywhere
in this pipeline. Every claim about an artifact must anchor to bytes that are
**stored** — the blob committed at the release ref — never to bytes that can be
regenerated. Two mistakes have already come from ignoring this: a reproduction
gate that could never pass, and a candidate bundle that named a commit whose
bytes it did not carry.

## A 404 on an old gitHead is expected, not tampering

Every version published before v0.6.1 (0.3.0 through 0.6.0, eight versions)
records an npm `gitHead` that returns HTTP 422 from
`gh api repos/opum-ai/quest-cli/commits/<sha>` — "No commit found for SHA".
This is a consequence of the 2026-09-10 repository deletion and recreation
(OPAG-70), not evidence of tampering, a broken reference, or a reason to
retag or republish anything. See QCLI-267 for the fullest measured case
(v0.6.0) and its forward fix.

**Nothing repairs this.** npm forbids republishing an existing version, and
the commits those `gitHead` values name are unrecoverable — the recreation
did not just move history, it replaced it. Re-pointing a tag to a surviving
commit would make the tag agree with the repository again but would still
disagree with the immutable npm `gitHead`, which cannot be changed at all.
The published tarballs, their checksums, and their SLSA provenance
attestations are all intact and correctly signed; only the commit their
provenance names has stopped existing. The cure is worse than the
condition, which is why this is a documentation entry and not a task.

The `release-provenance.mjs --pre`/`--post` gate wired into `release.yml`
(QCLI-267) prevents this class from recurring silently on any release from
v0.6.1 onward. It does not, and cannot, retroactively fix the eight versions
that predate it — a reader hitting a 422 on one of those `gitHead` values is
seeing the expected, permanent state of an already-published artifact, not a
new defect. Cite the immutable npm version, not the git tag or commit, when
that matters.

Check this from the live GitHub API, never from a local clone: the destroyed
commits still resolve inside a local clone's own loose objects (`git cat-file
-t <sha>` happily answers `commit`), because deletion-and-recreation replaced
what the *remote* serves, not what an existing local checkout had already
fetched. Only `gh api repos/opum-ai/quest-cli/commits/<sha>` — or an equally
fresh clone — shows the 422 that proves the commit is actually gone
(lore-cli, hitting the identical shape in its own repository).

## Exercising a build before it is published

To qualify changes that have not been released, dispatch the qualification
workflow against the branch and collect the `quest-candidate-bundle` artifact:

```sh
gh workflow run prepublication-qualification.yml --ref <branch>
gh run download <run-id> --name quest-candidate-bundle --dir candidate
```

The bundle is digest-pinned and reaches no registry. A consumer binds it with
`--quest-candidate` and installs Quest from the exact tarballs inside it,
recomputing every executable digest from those bytes.

State what it does and does not establish, rather than reporting the verdict
alone. Binding a candidate replaces per-platform CI-receipt rows with
candidate-byte rows: it gains live digest re-derivation and binds the binary
that actually runs the behavioural rows, and it loses execution attestation for
the platforms the running host cannot execute. Six targets attested becomes one
target executed plus six artifacts digest-bound. The native-execution receipt
covers the second, so the two are complementary rather than substitutes, and
neither is soak.

The consuming harness may also read the platform and root `package.json` from a
sibling source checkout rather than from the bundle. Tell the consumer which
checkout and which version to expect, and leave it there for the duration of
the run; a working tree that moves mid-run fails those rows on a mismatch that
has nothing to do with the candidate.

## A publish can land STAGED: accepted, reserved, and invisible

Measured during the 0.7.0 release, 2026-09-15 (QCLI-299). npm 12 has a
staged-publish flow: a version can sit in the registry **non-public, awaiting a
maintainer's 2FA approval**, and a staged version **occupies the same semver
unique index as a published one**. So a fourth state exists alongside
published / slow / absent, and nothing in the publish path names it.

What it looked like. `npm publish` returned success for
`@opum-ai/quest-darwin-x64@0.7.0` and the loop published five more packages
after it. The version never appeared: absent from `versions`, absent from
`time`, `dist-tags.latest` still `0.6.2`, and the packument's `time.modified`
still showing the previous day. Meanwhile `@opum-ai/quest@0.7.0` was live
advertising it as an `optionalDependency`, so a macOS x64 install succeeded
and left no binary -- silently, because optional dependencies do not fail an
install.

**The symptom that identifies it is a 409 on a re-publish attempt:**

```
http fetch PUT 409 https://registry.npmjs.org/@opum-ai%2fquest-darwin-x64
error code E409
error 409 Conflict - Cannot publish over previously staged version "0.7.0".
```

Two properties worth knowing before the next release:

- **The release token cannot see it.** `npm stage list` returned `[]` for the
  granular publishing token while the registry was refusing its PUT over a
  staged version that token had itself created. The publisher is blind to the
  thing blocking the publisher.
- **`time.modified` does not distinguish staged from never-written.** A staged
  version does not touch the public packument, so that field -- which looks
  decisive, and was used as decisive here before the 409 arrived -- separates
  "the public packument was not written" from "nothing happened", and those are
  different facts.

**Clearing it is an operator action and needs 2FA**, which is the entire point
of staging: `npm stage list` then `npm stage approve <stage-id>` from a
logged-in session, or the package's page on npmjs.com. The owner approved this
one roughly twelve minutes after the publish, and the staged tarball went
public **unmodified** -- shasum, integrity, file count and unpacked size all
identical to what the pre-publication receipt gate had verified, so candidate
digests do not need re-deriving after an approval.

That last sentence is measured, not inferred: the owner confirmed directly
that they approved it. It matters because the alternatives imply different
tooling. Staging that self-resolves would be a transient state worth waiting
out; staging cleared by a human is a procedure with a named actor, and a wait
loop pointed at it burns its entire window on something that was never going
to resolve on its own. The publish script reports it as its own outcome for
exactly that reason.

### Why one package of seven staged: undetermined, and here is what is ruled out

Recorded rather than guessed, and re-measured on 2026-09-15 rather than
carried over:

- **Nothing in this repository ever asks for a stage.** The CI release
  workflow (`.github/workflows/release.yml`, the per-target loop) and
  `scripts/publish-release.mjs` both invoke `npm publish --access public`.
  Neither calls `npm stage publish`. So the stage was created registry-side.
- **npm's own documentation says this should not happen.** `npm help stage`
  and the v12 docs describe staging as an explicit `npm stage publish`
  workflow, and GitHub's changelog dates the removal of direct publishing for
  2FA-bypass granular tokens to *around January 2027*. The observed behaviour
  on 2026-09-15 was neither: an ordinary `npm publish` with a granular token,
  landing in a stage, four months before the documented enforcement.
- **A per-package 2FA requirement is the most plausible remaining mechanism
  and cannot be checked from here.** `npm access set mfa=none|publish|automation`
  is settable per package, but nothing reads it back: `npm access get status`
  returns only `public`/`private`, and it returned `public` for all seven.
  So a per-package setting is neither confirmed nor excluded.
- **If it recurs, the measurement that would settle it** is the package's own
  settings page on npmjs.com, read by the owner -- the 2FA requirement is
  visible there and nowhere the release credential can reach.

Whatever the trigger, the publish path no longer depends on the answer: a
version that is not resolvable for a consumer blocks the wrapper, whether it
is staged, slow, or absent.

## The wrapper publish is gated on a CONSUMER-side read

Added by QCLI-299, after the failure above. Write order does not produce
visibility order, and on 0.7.0 the two disagreed in four of six positions.

`scripts/publish-release.mjs` publishes the six platform packages, then
**blocks until every one of them resolves from a read that is not the
publisher's** -- plain HTTPS to `registry.npmjs.org` with no credential and no
npmrc -- and only then publishes `@opum-ai/quest`. A package that resolves and
then stops resolving drops back to not-visible rather than counting, because an
installer hitting the stale CDN edge is in exactly that state.

**The second sense of publisher blindness, which is the one that survives
fixing the gate's position.** opum-cli-e2e timed 9-20 seconds between a
package's registry `time[0.7.0]` and its first resolution from a non-publishing
npm client, across five packages, bounded above by their 10s poll granularity.
A publisher-side poll therefore reports ready while an installer still resolves
the previous version -- so the gate holds a 30s settle margin after the last
package appears and re-reads before proceeding. Two distinct blindnesses, and
the release needs both handled: the publisher cannot see a stage it created,
and the publisher sees a publish before consumers do.

When the gate does not pass, the wrapper is **not** published -- so the failure
is a release that did not happen rather than one that installs and leaves no
binary -- and the script prints each unresolved package's state read from the
public registry at that moment. `--diagnose-staged` adds the one thing a read
cannot do: it re-attempts the publish, where a 409 "previously staged" means
staged and a success means it never landed. That costs a write, which is why it
is a flag and not part of the poll.

## Rollback

Before publication, discard only candidate artifacts and keep the evidence
showing that nothing was released. After publication, preserve the immutable
version, integrity values, source commit, and verification record. Do not
claim an unpublished candidate is available, overwrite published history, or
quietly replace an artifact. If withdrawal or deprecation is required, obtain
separate owner authorization and document the registry's actual state.
