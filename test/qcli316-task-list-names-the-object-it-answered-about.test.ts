/**
 * QCLI-316 / DEC-6. `quest task list --status "In Progress"` reads the
 * checked-out ref's `.quest/` and nothing else, while the rule that sends a
 * session to it -- check nothing is still open before reporting clear -- asks
 * about the REPOSITORY. The two diverge for exactly the tasks most likely to
 * be forgotten, the ones still on an unmerged branch, and the failure
 * direction is the bad one: AN EMPTY LIST READS AS THE CHECK PASSING RATHER
 * THAN AS THE CHECK NOT RUNNING.
 *
 * Reported by opum-doc, who ran it on `dev` right after a merge and got an
 * empty list while one of their own tasks was In Progress with an open PR.
 * They caught it only because an independent source disagreed with the empty
 * list -- which is the detection lesson, since neither the exit code nor the
 * output would ever have shown it.
 *
 * THE NOTICE IS A SET DIFFERENCE, NOT A COUNT. The naive version printed every
 * task record on every other ref -- 122 lines in their repository, ~4,500
 * across 20 refs here -- essentially all of which the current ref already
 * held. A notice that fires constantly is tuned out by its second appearance.
 * After the difference: one line for them, ZERO here. Its APPEARANCE is the
 * signal, so the tests below pin BOTH halves -- it fires when it must, and it
 * is quiet when it must be. Proving only the quiet half would ship a notice
 * indistinguishable from one that never fires, which is the trap this suite
 * exists to avoid elsewhere too.
