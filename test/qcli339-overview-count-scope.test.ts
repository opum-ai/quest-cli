/**
 * QCLI-339. `overview` counted `taskSnapshot.tasks`, which
 * `LocalTaskRepository.readAll` narrows to `location === "tasks"`. So a
 * SUCCESSFUL `task complete` removed the record from the counts instead of
 * moving them: `total` fell by one and the terminal bucket never grew. A
 * session that completed work and re-read `overview` was handed
 * positive-looking evidence that its write had failed.
 *
 * The sharp version of the defect, and what these tests pin: there are two
 * supported routes to the terminal status and they moved `overview` in
 * OPPOSITE directions. `task complete` relocates to `completed/` and the
 * record vanished from the counts; `task edit --status Done` does not
 * relocate and the record stayed counted. So the terminal bucket was
 * populated exclusively by the route that bypasses relocation -- in a
 * freshly initialized workspace it could only ever hold records completed
 * the way the task-finalization guide says NOT to.
 *
 * Every figure below is cross-checked against the DIRECTORIES, never against
 * `quest search`, which returns archived records and skews counts
 * release-shaped.
