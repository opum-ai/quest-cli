/**
 * QCLI-355. One nonexistent flag got two contradictory diagnoses depending
 * only on how many times it was passed:
 *
 *   task edit T-1 --add-ac a --add-ac b  ->  "--add-ac may only be provided once."
 *   task edit T-1 --add-ac a             ->  "Unrecognized flag --add-ac. ..."
 *
 * The repeated form asserted that the flag EXISTS and has an arity rule, so
 * the reporter retried it one occurrence per call, four times, before the
 * single form revealed it was never real. It also said neither "nothing was
 * written" nor which flags are accepted.
 *
 * Cause: `flags()` collects arguments without knowing the accepted set, and
 * threw the arity error during collection, before dispatch reached
 * `only()`/`usageFailure`, the code that knows the allowed list. The fix
 * defers the arity verdict to `only()`, which checks the name first.
 *
 * The other half (a KNOWN non-repeatable flag still reports arity) is pinned
 * across every single-value flag by `test/contract/cli-process.test.ts`
 * ("every single-value flag rejects repeats ..."); one case is repeated here
 * so this file reads whole.
