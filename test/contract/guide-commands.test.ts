/**
 * Every `quest` command a guide shows must actually run (QCLI-148).
 *
 * QCLI-141 shipped a task-finalization recipe calling `task edit
 * --final-summary` before that flag existed, so the guide exited 2 at the last
 * step of every task. A reviewer caught it by executing the guide by hand.
 *
 * The hard part of a guard like this is not running the commands, it is
 * finding them. An extractor that silently skips what it does not recognize
 * gives false confidence: the guide looks covered and is not. So every
 * non-empty line inside a fence must be recognized as a command, and an
 * unrecognized one fails rather than disappearing.
