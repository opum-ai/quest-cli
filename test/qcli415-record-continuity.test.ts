/**
 * QCLI-415, DEC-18 option A (operator-accepted 2026-09-29): a base-relative
 * record-continuity check, so a commit that DROPS a task record cannot pass a
 * repository green.
 *
 * The measured motivation, from DEC-18's own context: ward-cli b2aad11 staged
 * only the deletion half of `task complete`'s relocation, so dev carried no
 * WCLI-9 record at all -- and the Tracker integrity job was green on it and on
 * the next commit, because that job parses a listing and never asks whether
 * anything went missing. A record may legitimately live in any of three
 * locations and moves between them, so "the file is gone" is not by itself a
 * defect; "the id resolves nowhere" is.
 *
 * Every case below runs against real Git commits in a real workspace, because
 * the check's whole input is a commit graph: the base is a ref, the thing it
 * reads is a tree, and the current store is the worktree. A mocked history
 * would not exercise the part that was wrong in the incident.
 *
 * The two-sided proof (AC2/AC3 of QCLI-415): a deliberate drop goes red and
 * names the id, while every legitimate relocation -- complete, archive, demote
 * -- stays green. A check that only had the red half would fail every opened
 * PR; one that only had the green half would be the status quo that missed
 * WCLI-9.
