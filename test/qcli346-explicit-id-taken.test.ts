/**
 * QCLI-346. `task create` threw `task_already_exists` for a taken id, and the
 * CLI mapped that to `conflict` with "read the latest task state and retry".
 *
 * That mapping is correct for exactly one of the two cases it covers. An
 * AUTO-ALLOCATED id losing a race to a concurrent writer is a real conflict:
 * a retry recomputes a fresh id and succeeds. An id the caller passed with
 * `--id` is fixed, so the prescribed retry can never succeed -- opum-cli-e2e
 * followed the hint three times against an id held by an ARCHIVED record.
 *
 * The archived case is the one worth pinning rather than a generic duplicate:
 * a completed or archived holder is invisible to `task list`, and `doctor`
 * reported healthy throughout, so every signal a caller can reach said the
 * workspace was fine. The error now names the holding path for that reason.
 *
 * The auto-allocated branch is covered here too, because the fix is a
 * NARROWING -- the risk it carries is over-reaching into the conflict case,
 * which a test of the explicit path alone cannot see.
