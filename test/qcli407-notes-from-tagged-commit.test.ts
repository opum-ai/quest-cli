/**
 * QCLI-407, twin of lore-cli LCLI-639. The release notes used to be read from
 * the CHECKOUT's CHANGELOG.md, so an uncommitted edit -- or work that landed
 * after the tag -- became the body of a new release. They are now read at the
 * commit v<version> peels to, through the GitHub API, on every path: the
 * pre-move refusal, the cut, and the standalone repair tool.
 *
 * Only pre-change symbols are imported at module scope (changelogSection,
 * releaseNotesFor), so this file RUNS against the pre-change module and fails
 * on its verdicts rather than at import. A control test that imports a symbol
 * the change adds dies before it can fail for the right reason.
 *
 * The fence predicate and the CRLF normalisation are a paired rule: lore-cli
 * implements the same two predicates, and a change to either here is a
 * divergence to agree with them before landing.
