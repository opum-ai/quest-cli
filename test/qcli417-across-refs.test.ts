/**
 * QCLI-417 / DEC-40 (operator-accepted 2026-09-29, ODOC-330): the read-only,
 * repository-true view over `origin/dev` plus the head of every open PR into
 * `dev` -- `quest task list --across-refs`.
 *
 * The fixtures are REAL Git repositories, because every claim this command
 * makes is a claim about the commit graph: `origin/dev` is read at the SHA the
 * REMOTE advertises (never the possibly stale local ref), a PR head at the SHA
 * discovery returned, and objects are fetched only when they are absent. A
 * mocked graph would not exercise the part that can be wrong. The one thing
 * that cannot be real here is the forge -- `gh pr list` is behind an
 * injectable seam, so these tests inject discovery and never touch the
 * network. The CLI-level cases use the REAL adapter on an origin that is not
 * GitHub, which is how the discovery-failure path is reached without depending
 * on whether `gh` happens to be installed on the machine running the suite.
 *
 * BOTH HALVES OF EVERY DETECTION ARE PINNED. A view that always answered
 * `complete: true` and one that always answered `conflict: true` would each
 * satisfy the happy path, so the complete case, the incomplete case, the
 * agreeing pair and the conflicting pair are all asserted -- and a run that
 * read ZERO refs fails rather than passing, which is the positive control that
 * makes the coverage report something other than a promise.
