/**
 * QCLI-342. The overview guide documented the success envelope as
 * `{schemaVersion, kind, data, principal}`, omitting `contractVersion` --
 * which QCLI-289 added and which the shared command contract fixes at index
 * 1. It also said "the envelope", singular, while success and error are two
 * shapes sharing no payload key.
 *
 * That sentence is the highest-traffic one quest ships: this repository's
 * CLAUDE.md requires every agent to run `quest instructions overview` before
 * acting, so it is read immediately before someone writes a jq path. An
 * incomplete key list is the wrong input at exactly that moment.
 *
 * These tests compare the GUIDE TEXT against the envelope the CLI ACTUALLY
 * EMITS, rather than against the source constant, so the two cannot drift
 * apart again without a test going red. Asserting the guide against the
 * source would only prove the file agrees with itself.
