/**
 * QCLI-290. QCLI-279 made ONE of three id allocators refs-aware and
 * deliberately left the other two alone pending a real reproduction. That
 * reproduction arrived on 2026-09-14: two sessions independently minted
 * `DEC-3` from branches neither of which carried the other's record.
 *
 * These tests reproduce the two trigger shapes -- an unmerged sibling
 * branch, and a detached HEAD behind a branch that has since moved --
 * against real processes and a real Git repository, for each of the three
 * remaining id families. A deliberately constructed collision is the right
 * instrument here rather than the live incident, which is not reproducible
 * on demand; that is the choice QCLI-279's own suite made.
 *
 * Two of them exist for reasons no draft-side test can cover, because
 * milestones and decisions share one `.quest/planning.json` where tasks and
 * drafts get a file each:
 *
 *   - "does not advance the milestone counter" pins the prefix filter. Both
 *     families live in the same document, so a scan that took the maximum of
 *     everything it read would let `DEC-9` mint `M-10`.
 *   - "a corrupt planning.json on one ref" pins the GRANULARITY of the
 *     degradation. Three refs, one of them unparseable: the answer is only
 *     right if the scan skips that ref and still reads the others. A guard
 *     coarse enough to abandon the whole scan on the first parse failure
 *     falls back to the local-only view, which is the un-fixed behavior --
 *     so an assertion that merely required "sequential" would have passed
 *     against the bug. It asserts the exact id instead.
