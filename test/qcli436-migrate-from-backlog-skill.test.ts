/**
 * QCLI-436: the `migrate-from-backlog` skill walks the person through
 * `quest migration backlog`, and three of the things it promises are
 * ABSENCES -- preview writes nothing, a digest other than the one just
 * previewed is not applied, and rollback gives the tree back.
 *
 * An absence is the shape a broken run passes for free: a migration that
 * read nothing writes nothing and looks exactly like one that read
 * everything and correctly withheld it. So every absence below is checked
 * beside a positive control in the same test -- the same run has to show
 * it found the records, or applied the digest, or changed something for
 * rollback to give back. Without that, "wrote nothing" is satisfied by a
 * no-op.
 *
 * Everything runs against a throwaway repository with a small backlog/,
 * because the claim is about what the lifecycle does to a working tree.
