/**
 * QCLI-340, the milestone half of QCLI-339's ruling: `overview` must not
 * report a count whose object is narrower than the object a reader takes it
 * for.
 *
 * `overview` counts milestones as open or closed with `archived !== true` on
 * BOTH filters, so an archived milestone counted as neither. That exclusion
 * is QCLI-140's decision and is correct -- a retired milestone is not open
 * work and is not closed work. What was wrong is that it lived only in a code
 * comment: `open + closed` silently summed to less than the milestones on
 * record, with nothing in the output saying so.
 *
 * So these tests pin BOTH halves, which fail on opposite edits: the archived
 * milestone is reported, AND it is still excluded from open/closed. Folding
 * it back into `closed` would satisfy "the number moved" while reopening
 * QCLI-140.
