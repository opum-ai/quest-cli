/**
 * QCLI-344. `task create` writes `implementationNotes` with
 * `--implementation-notes`; `task edit` wrote the SAME FIELD with `--notes`.
 * A caller moving from create to edit on one record met a rejection for a
 * capability that existed under another spelling.
 *
 * The rejection itself already named the offending flag and listed every
 * accepted one, so the discoverability half was largely served. What it did
 * NOT say is that the rest of the invocation was discarded -- and the
 * reported case paired the bad flag with `--check-ac`, so the observable
 * outcome was an acceptance criterion that silently failed to check.
 * Atomicity is correct and unchanged; the message now states it.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT in scope: a wholesale `--references` on `task edit`. That
 * is a different shape, not the same asymmetry -- edit offers non-destructive
 * `--add-reference`/`--remove-reference`, and DEC-5 recorded the hazard of
 * wholesale replacement discarding checked state on a neighbouring field.
 * Pinned below so the omission reads as a decision.
