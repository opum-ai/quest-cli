// version's CHANGELOG.md section AT THE COMMIT THE TAG PEELS TO, read
// through the GitHub API rather than from the checkout this runs in
// (QCLI-398, opum-agent OPAG-646; QCLI-407, paired with lore-cli LCLI-639).
//
// GitHub Releases stopped at v0.6.0 because nothing in the release flow ever
// created one: every later release moved npm `latest` and left GitHub saying
// v0.6.0. promote-release.mjs now calls ensureGitHubRelease once `latest` is
// verified moved, so the step cannot be skipped again. This file is also the
// backfill and the repair tool:
//
//   node scripts/github-release.mjs --version 0.11.0            # dry run
//   node scripts/github-release.mjs --version 0.11.0 --create   # cut it
//   node scripts/github-release.mjs --version 0.9.0 --create --not-latest
//
// It never creates a tag (`--verify-tag`), never edits an existing release's
// body, and pins the host (`-R github.com/...`) so GH_HOST cannot redirect it.
// An existing release counts as done only when it is published and carries
// these notes (QCLI-401, paired with lore-cli LCLI-622). A draft, a
// prerelease, or different notes is refused and left for a person to repair --
// except for the recorded legacy releases, whose stored bodies are records
// written after their tags and are reported with their reasons instead.

 * 0.8.0 were cut or backfilled on 2026-09-27 from a working tree that differed
 * from their tag, so every one of them now differs from the section at the
 * commit its tag peels to. 0.6.0 was added afterwards (QCLI-410) and differs
 * under the old comparison too: its body is an out-of-band provenance record
 * that exists nowhere in CHANGELOG.md, and the tag's section is what still
 * matches the file.
 *
 * Every difference is text authored AFTER its tag -- additions for 0.6.2 and
 * 0.7.0, and for 0.6.0, 0.6.1 and 0.8.0 a record that rewrites or replaces
 * part of the section, 0.6.1's keeping none of it -- and rewriting a body to
 * match an earlier section would delete that text, so the bodies are kept and
 * this table records why.
 *
 * What the table does NOT do is re-check the stored bytes against the reason
 * (measured, and accepted for a closed set of frozen historical releases;
 * pinning the bodies would close it if that changes). A body edited to
 * anything other than the tagged bytes is still reported with its reason. A
 * body reconciled exactly to the tagged section deliberately stops being a
 * recorded exception and is treated as matching -- marked latest when asked
 * -- because the recorded branch sits in the mismatch path; that is the one
 * edit this table cannot report.
 *
 * A CLOSED table, deliberately: only a version named here is reported as a
 * recorded exception, every other release keeps the notes-differ refusal, and
 * adding a version is a deliberate, reviewable edit to this map. It REPORTS
 * rather than exempts silently -- the run names the version's reason, so an
 * operator sees a recorded decision instead of a clean bill of health.
