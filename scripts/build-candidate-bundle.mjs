// Digest-pinned candidate bundle (QCLI-135 follow-through).
//
// A candidate bundle lets downstream qualification exercise an UNPUBLISHED
// build: opum-cli-e2e binds it with `--quest-candidate`, installs Quest from
// the exact tarballs inside it, and recomputes every executable digest live
// from those bytes. Nothing reaches a registry.
//
// It exists because the alternative for exercising unreleased changes is
// publishing them, and "publish it and see" is not a qualification strategy.
//
// What binding a candidate gains and loses, stated here so nobody has to infer
// it from a passing report (opum-cli-e2e's own design note says the same):
//   GAINED  every digest is recomputed from these tarball bytes at run time,
//           and the binary that actually runs the ~400 behavioural rows is the
//           one in this bundle.
//   LOST    execution attestation for the five platforms the running host
//           cannot execute. This bundle proves a tarball containing a binary
//           of digest X exists for win32-arm64; it proves nothing ran there.
// The native-execution receipt is what covers the second, and the two are
// complementary rather than substitutes.
//
// This must run where all six platform packages exist. Bun cannot cross-compile
// bun-windows-aarch64, so that is CI after the platform matrix, never a laptop.
